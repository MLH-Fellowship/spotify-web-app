# SpotiMe üéß - MLH Fellowship Pod 3.3.0 Team 1 
SpotiMe is a react web app that uses the Spotify API and Machine Learning Emotion detection to recommend music based on emotions and music taste.
Once the user logs in with their spotify account, the website shows the summary of the user's music breakdown. 
The user can click the button "Play" to initiate a camera to capture the user's face (through front camera/webcam) which is analyzed by our ML model to detect the user's emotion. Based on the emotion detected, the user will receive a customized playlist by SpotiME!

## How we built it üõ†

![Architecture](./documentation/spotime-archi.png)
__To collaborate, we used:__
 - Git 
 - Discord chat / voice call

__To design the website, we used:__
 - Figma

__To build the website, we used:__
 - React 
 - Flask
 - [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
 - ML Emotion Detection Library [FER](https://pypi.org/project/fer/)

__We deployed our website using:__
   - AWS EC2
   - Duck DNS
   - Nginx

__We tested and monitored it with:__
   - Github Actions
   - cAdvisor
   - Prometheus
   - Grafana

__We set up our database using:__
   - mongoDB

__Cool repo visualization jus for fun:__

## Challenges we ran into üò°
- Our ML module was hard to deploy. We failed to deploy it on Haroku and ended up migrating it on AWS.
- Another issue we kept facing an Nginx and CORS error.
- Miscellaneous errors such as a bug 403 Forbidden page or connection issue, as well as a process such as integrating all frontend and backend was challenging but we were able to 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üåü
- We are proud of our overall project. However, we are specifically proud of successfully athenticaing Spotify API, connecting the ML module with the captured photo to detect the emotion, clean and user friendly UI, being able to tackle challenging issues that arised during the deployment. The team had excellent communication skills and collaboration to successfully accomplishing the project! In addition, we are very proud that what we've built hasn't commonly done before - that we are one of the pioneers of the new way of song recommendation. 


## Spotify Authorization üóù

The Spotify Authentication Service works like this (obtained from the [official documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)):

<div align="center">

</div>

### Get Spotify API credentials üéª
 - Go to the [Spotify API console](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and login with a Spotify account.
 - Create a new application. You'll see you Client_id and Client_secret credentials, will need them later.
 - Go to the app settings and add you Redirect URIs' and save it.

### Create .env ü§´
 - Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add the following with your corresponding credentials:
 ```sh
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-cliend-secret>
REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URL=<your-redirect-uri>
```

The Redirect Uri needs to match any of the ones in your Spotify API dashboard app.

### How we do the authorization ‚úÖ

When the user logs in in our app, they will be sent to the auccounts authorization url of spotify so they can grant access to our app to see their info. We ask for them the following scopes:

 - "user-top-read"
 - "user-read-email"
 - "user-read-private"
 - "user-library-read"
 - "user-library-modify"
 - "user-read-currently-playing"
 - "user-read-playback-state"
 - "playlist-read-private"
 - "playlist-modify-public"
 - "playlist-modify-private"
 - "user-modify-playback-state"

#### Observation ‚ö†Ô∏è

Since we are using the development mode of the Spotify API you'll need to add the users' email you want to authorize to your app on the dashboard of Spotify API.

### How the Spotify Authorization url would look like üîó

```
`https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&client_secret=${CLIENT_SECRET}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URL_AFTER_LOGIN}&scope=${SCOPES_URL_PARAM}&response_type=code`;
```

### How the url we get looks like üîó

Once the user grants access Spotify redirects to the Redirect URI we passed giving a code in the params

```
https://our-url.com/home?code=AQAiJfIMNNQpM...
```

 - There is a function in the useEffect of ```frontend/layouts/Home/index.js``` that takes care of grabbing that code
 - We have and endpoint in our backend that changes that code for and ```access_token``` and a ```refresh_token```
 - The ``access_token``` is needed to authenticate in all requests we make to the API.

### Spotify API endpoints üé∏üé∂

The Spotify API Endpoint we query to are the following:

 - [Spotify Authorization endpoint](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)
 - [Get user's info](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-current-users-profile)
 - [Top playlists](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-playlists)
 - [Top artists](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-personalization)
 - [Top tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-personalization)
 - [Get a Playlist tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlist-tracks/)
 - [Follow a playlist](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-follow)
 - [Get user's available devices](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-a-users-available-devices)
 - [Player API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-player)

### How we get the playlist of the recommendation üîé

We use on the backend the [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) library to handle getting playlists from spotify. We use the function ```search()``` and pass as first param the emotion and genre as ```{emotion: genre}``` and as second param the search type we want which is a playlist ```search_type="playlist```. This return an array of playlists and we just pick first option we get since is the more adequate of the search.

### How do we play songs on users' Spotify ü•Å

 - First we query the [get user's available devices](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-a-users-available-devices) to look for an available device. 
 - The user needs to have a Spotify app open in any of their devices
 - Once we get the ```id``` of one we make a PUT request to the [player API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-player) passing as parameter this device.

### How do we add to library playlists on users' Spotify üéπ
 - Put Request to [follow a playlist endpoint](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-follow) with the ```id``` of the playlist we want.
